## [Unreleased]

### Monsterray fork

- Match browser HNAP login signatures/cookies, support explicit MD5/SHA256, and
  use standard HTTP with browser-style headers by default.
- Preserve literal Unicode passwords and significant spaces; redact authentication
  response bodies, session-cookie details, and command-line secrets from diagnostics.
- Prevent login retries, redirect replays, and implicit reauthentication after
  rejection or an uncertain login; stop status batches on connection/session failure.
- Add bounded monitoring, one-request channels-only sampling, offline browser-HAR
  comparison, and a cited cross-repository improvement plan.
- Fix remaining type errors and keep automated tests offline with enforced network guards.
- Reject failed challenge outcomes before submitting credentials, preserve wrapped
  event logs, and report the timeout actually used by CLI requests.
- Include shared fixtures and protocol vectors in source distributions; validate
  wheel/source metadata and test the source archive in CI.
- Add explicit LAN-interface selection for modem requests and connectivity checks
  after tracing connection timeouts to a VPN route; verify one live S33v2 sample.
- Read S33v2 uptime from connection info and internet status from device status,
  and parse its days/hours/minutes/seconds uptime notation.
- Reach 99.80% combined coverage and 100% line coverage with offline tests; raise
  the required coverage gate to 99% without adding exclusions.
- Fix public log retrieval and ordering, exact channel lock checks, empty-message
  status timeout retries, raised HTTP authentication denials, and malformed
  metadata/HAR handling discovered by the expanded tests.
